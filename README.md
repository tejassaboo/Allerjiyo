# Allerjiyo
Inspiring People to Live Life to the Fullest Despite Allergies
<br>

Millions of Americans are developing allergies. The food industry has not completely shifted to accommodate all of these restrictions. In many situations, having allergies can be quite difficult and dangerous. For example, when eating out, you would need to completely trust your server or the allergy menu to ensure your safety. The allergy community must come together.

Allerjiyo is derived from the hindi term “jiyo,” meaning life, a fitting term since our goal is to inspire people to live despite allergies. Allerjiyo is a platform that connects the community to share their experiences with allergies. Through this social platform, Allerjians (the users of the application) inspire fellow allerjians to live without constant fear of their allergies. Allerjians share their successes with allergies to create hope, sharing their story and experiences with allergies and how they continue to live fulfilling lives. Allerjians provide recommendations to the local community about recipes, doctors, and remedies -- helping their community enjoy more freedom despite their allergies. ​
